==========
The log for OpenVAS Manager is useful for troubleshooting and is located here:

```
/usr/local/var/log/openvas/openvasmd.log
```

The files `openvassd.dump` and `openvassd.messages` in the same directory may also be useful to you.

The directories `feeds/NVT` and `feeds/SCAP` (on the host machine, in this repo) should only contain files put there by OpenVAS.
